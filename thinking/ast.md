## Background

Recently, I had a programming assignment to build a CLI interface for simple vector calculations, like a rudimentary Matlab or Octave. This frustrated me for two reasons:
1. I'm currently a junior. This means that I have about two or so solid years of programming experience at this point. I've had countless programming assignments that involved "building a simple CLI interface to do x". I don't know what this assignment is supposed to teach me, because I should know how to take user input and operate on it by now. 
2. I should know how to take user input and operate on it by now. I should know how to take user input and operate on it by now. Why don't I know how to take user input and operate on it? Why is this so hard?


How does an interpreter work? How does they Python REPL always work when I give it a valid input, no matter how long or how complex, and how come it always knows when I typed something in wrong? These are the questions that haunted me late on a Friday night. 

Instead of doing the things any college kid is supposed to do on a Friday evening, I had found myself at 2 AM sitting on the ground outside the grocery store near my apartment. I had been walking with a friend, but I'd been temporarily abandoned by him for a member of his opposite sex. I'm sitting there on my phone looking like an insane person, frantically googling strategies for reading user input.  

I had stumbled on a stackoverflow post that linked to [this [0]](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm) article by Theodore Novell, which opens with the line "I'll assume you know at least a little bit about context free grammars".
